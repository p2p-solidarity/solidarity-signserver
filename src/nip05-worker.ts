 * NIP-05 directory worker — the `creds.id` id service on its own.
 *
 * Deployed with `wrangler.nip05.jsonc` into the Cloudflare account that owns
 * the creds.id zone (a Worker route can only be attached from the
 * account the zone lives in), separate from the inbox / PassKit worker in
 * `src/index.ts`, which stays in its own account with its own D1. Same
 * handlers, same schema (`drizzle/`), only the nip05 router and its audit
 * cleanup cron are mounted. `bun run deploy:nip05` does the whole thing.
