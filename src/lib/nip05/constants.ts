 * Name syntax (design §4 / G1). Two deliberate restrictions:

 *   handle shape. The app/web `matchHandleResolver` registry is
 *   first-match-wins (ENS → ATProto → DNS), so `/@alice.dev` would be claimed
 *   by the ATProto resolver and resolve to the wrong person. Excluding `.`
 *   makes `matches` a pure syntactic partition: dotted → atproto/ens/dns,
 *   dotless → nip05. The two namespaces then cannot collide by construction.
 * - **No punctuation** — v1 issues only lowercase ASCII letters and digits.
 *   This avoids lookalike and routing edge cases as one entire class.
 * - **Minimum 3** — short names are part of the free identity surface; there
 *   is no paid short-name inventory.
